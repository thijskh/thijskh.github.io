Welcome to my website!

I am a historian of science and medicine. I work as an assistant professor at
Utrecht University, the Netherlands, where I teach academic integrity and carry
out research on the changing role of medicine in birth and death. More about my
research, including my previous projects, [here](research).

Every other week, I write a column for the Dutch newspaper _Trouw_, about how
science works. You can read some of them [here](columns).
